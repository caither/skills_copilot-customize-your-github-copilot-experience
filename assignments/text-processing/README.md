# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Master string manipulation, file I/O operations, and text processing techniques to build practical tools for reading, analyzing, and transforming text data.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Text Analysis Tool

#### Description
Create a program that reads a text file and performs comprehensive analysis on its contents. The program should process text data and generate meaningful statistics.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read text from a user-specified file or use a provided sample file
- Count total words, sentences, and unique words
- Calculate average word length
- Identify and display the most frequent words (top 10)
- Handle file not found errors gracefully
- Display results in a clear, formatted output

### 🛠️ Text Transformation Tool

#### Description
Build a text transformation utility that applies various text processing operations. Students will practice string methods and file I/O simultaneously.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Accept text input and transformation options (uppercase, lowercase, remove duplicates, reverse lines)
- Apply multiple text transformations based on user selection
- Save transformed text to an output file
- Preserve original formatting where appropriate
- Handle empty files and invalid input gracefully
- Provide a menu-driven interface for choosing operations

### 🛠️ Text Search and Replace

#### Description
Implement a search and replace utility that finds patterns in text files and replaces them with user-specified content. Practice regex or string matching techniques.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file and search for specific words or phrases
- Replace occurrences with new text (case-sensitive or insensitive)
- Save results to a new file without modifying the original
- Display count of replacements made
- Support multiple find-and-replace operations in one run
- Validate that replacements were completed successfully
